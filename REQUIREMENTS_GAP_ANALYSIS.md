# Requirements Gap Analysis - AI Agent Using GraphRAG

## Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment: ✅ WORKABLE with identified gaps**

The current codebase provides a **solid foundation** (70-75% complete) for the AI Agent using GraphRAG requirements. The core security-first architecture, graph database integration, and RAG pipeline are well-established. However, several user-facing features and advanced NLU capabilities need development.

## ✅ Fully Implemented Requirements

### 3.3 Schema Catalog & Embeddings
**Status: 100% Complete**
- ✅ `graph_rag/schema_catalog.py` - Automated schema extraction from Neo4j
- ✅ `allow_list.json` generation with labels, relationships, and properties
- ✅ `graph_rag/embeddings.py` - Vector embedding generation with OpenAI
- ✅ Schema validation in `CypherGenerator`

### 3.4 Query Generation
**Status: 95% Complete**
- ✅ Validated Cypher generation via templates (`cypher_generator.py`)
- ✅ Parameterized queries to prevent injection
- ✅ Label/relationship validation against allow-list
- ✅ Security constraints enforced
- ⚠️ Gap: Limited template coverage (only 2 query intents)

### 3.5 Execution & Response (Backend)
**Status: 85% Complete**
- ✅ Cypher execution with timeouts (`neo4j_client.py`)
- ✅ GraphRAG augmentation with hierarchy expansion (`retriever.py`)
- ✅ Dual retrieval (structured Cypher + vector similarity)
- ✅ LLM integration for summarization (`rag.py`)
- ✅ Citation verification system
- ❌ Gap: No structured output formatting (table/graph views)

### 3.6 Guardrails & Observability
**Status: 100% Complete**
- ✅ Read-only execution mode (default in `neo4j_client.py`)
- ✅ Query timeouts (10s default)
- ✅ Graph traversal depth limits (max_traversal_depth: 2)
- ✅ OpenTelemetry tracing (`observability.py`)
- ✅ Prometheus metrics (4 key metrics)
- ✅ Structured logging with `structlog`
- ✅ Audit trail (`audit_store.py` with `audit_log.jsonl`)

### 5.2 Schema Management
**Status: 100% Complete**
- ✅ Automated schema extraction
- ✅ Allow-list as single source of truth
- ✅ Embedding pipeline for schema terms

### 5.3 Query Processing Pipeline
**Status: 80% Complete**
- ✅ Steps 1-8 implemented in `planner.py` → `retriever.py` → `rag.py`
- ⚠️ Gap: Semantic search uses basic LLM extraction, not full embedding similarity

### 5.4 Security & Governance
**Status: 95% Complete**
- ✅ Read-only execution
- ✅ Input validation (label/relationship sanitization)
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Audit trail with trace IDs
- ⚠️ Gap: No input sanitization for free-text user queries

## ⚠️ Partially Implemented Requirements

### 3.2 Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
**Status: 60% Complete**

**Implemented:**
- ✅ User query ingestion via FastAPI (`main.py`)
- ✅ Basic entity extraction using LLM structured output (`planner.py`)

**Gaps:**
- ❌ No synonym expansion for schema terms
- ❌ No embedding similarity search for term mapping (uses simple LLM extraction)
- ❌ No heuristic matching for ambiguous terms
- 🔧 **Recommendation**: Extend `planner.py` with:
